The probabilistic inference (pyPI) module
=========================================

The probabilistic inference (pyPI) module allows ML fast prototyping. In 
particular, it focuses on binary classification problems. The models can 
be evaluated and inspected easily. Also, these models are saved as 
pickled files for future use.

The typical usage looks like this::

  >>> import pyPI
  >>> print "Test"
